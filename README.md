# Identify-Customer-Segments
UDACITY - Intro to Machine Learning
The data and design for this project were provided by Arvato Financial Services.
There are two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company.
We've looked at relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and checked how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.
Unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households were applied. 
Data has been preprocessed, dimensionality reduction techniques were applied, 
and clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company were implemented.


Why this project?

The unsupervised learning branch of machine learning is key in the organization of large and complex datasets.
While unsupervised learning lies in contrast to supervised learning in the fact that unsupervised learning lacks objective output classes or values,
it can still be important in converting the data into a form that can be used in a supervised learning task.
Dimensionality reduction techniques can help surface the main signals and associations in your data,
providing supervised learning techniques a more focused set of features upon which to apply their work.
Clustering techniques are useful for understanding how the data points themselves are organized.
These clusters might themselves be a useful feature in a directed supervised learning task.
This project will give you hands-on experience with a real-life task that makes use of these techniques,
focusing on the unsupervised work that goes into understanding a dataset.

In addition, the dataset presented in this project requires a number of assessment and cleaning steps before you can apply your machine learning methods.
In workplace contexts, you will frequently need to work with data that is untidy or needs preprocessing before standard algorithms and models can be applied.
The ability to perform data wrangling and the ability to make decisions on data that you work with are both valuable skills that you will practice in this project.
